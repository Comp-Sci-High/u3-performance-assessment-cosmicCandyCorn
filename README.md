Why did you pick this API topic?
 I picked this topic because i love ice cream, and when you really think about it like dont we all??? So i picked something relatable.

Describe your API and the available data endpoints
My Api is an ice cream Api and the available endpoints are /classic, /nutty, /sorbet, /dessert, and /topten

How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?
I feel like it was more fun making my own Api. Using it as a client was so hard and i didnt like how often the api keys would expire
